Several items in tasks.md are marked as complete but have gaps, or marked with strikethrough but flags still exist in CLI. Need comprehensive audit to ensure tracking doc matches reality. Known issues: --label filter was marked incomplete but flag existed, --project flags exist but ignored, label add idempotency not implemented.
