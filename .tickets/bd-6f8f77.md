Updated CI workflow with UI linting and Tauri build jobs.

## Changes Made

Added two new jobs to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

### lint-ui
- Runs on: ubuntu-latest
- Steps: checkout, setup-bun, bun install, lint, format:check, svelte-check

### build-tauri
- Runs on: macos-latest
- Steps: checkout, setup-bun, setup-rust, rust-cache, bun install, build, tauri-action
- Uses tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0 for building

Both jobs run on PRs and pushes to main.
