## Changes Made

### +page.svelte

- New header with search input, view tabs, and command palette trigger
- Tabs component for Table/Kanban view switching
- Sheet component for detail panel (slides in from right)
- Maintained keyboard navigation (j/k, arrows, escape)

### IssuePanel.svelte

- Refactored to pure list renderer (removed internal headers/filters)
- Reused for Table view

### DetailPanel.svelte

- Simplified to fit within Sheet component
- Removed fixed positioning and internal close buttons

### New Features

- Kanban view with columns: Open, In Progress, Blocked, Closed
- Real-time search filtering across views
- Responsive layout with horizontal scrolling

## Verification

- `bun run check` passes (0 errors)
