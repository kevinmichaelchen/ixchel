# Arya Stark

**Alias:** No One
**House:** Stark

Arya Stark is the youngest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully, a fierce and independent girl who rejected the traditional path of a noblewoman from the moment she could hold a sword. While her sister Sansa dreamed of princes and gowns, Arya preferred archery, sword fighting, and adventure. Her half-brother Jon Snow recognized her spirit and gave her a slender sword she named Needle—a gift that would become her most treasured possession and a symbol of her identity.

Arya's life changed forever when she witnessed her father's execution in King's Landing. Escaping the city disguised as a boy, she survived the War of the Five Kings through cunning, luck, and sheer determination, traveling with everyone from the Night's Watch recruits to the outlaw Brotherhood Without Banners. Along the way, she compiled a kill list of those who had wronged her family, reciting their names like a prayer each night. Her journey eventually led her across the Narrow Sea to Braavos, where she trained with the Faceless Men at the House of Black and White.

Under the tutelage of Jaqen H'ghar, Arya learned the deadly arts of the Faceless Men—assassination, disguise, and the ability to literally wear other faces. Though she embraced the identity of "No One" during her training, Arya ultimately rejected the Faceless Men's philosophy, choosing to remain Arya Stark of Winterfell. She returned to Westeros to cross names off her list, eliminating House Frey in revenge for the Red Wedding. In the Battle of Winterfell, Arya struck the killing blow against the Night King, saving humanity from the army of the dead. After the wars ended, she set sail west of Westeros to explore unknown lands, embodying her father's words: "The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives."
