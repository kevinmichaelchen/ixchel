# Rickard Stark

**House:** Stark
**Titles:** Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North

Rickard Stark was the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North during the years leading up to Robert's Rebellion. Known for his quick temper and strong sense of honor, he ruled the North with the stern justice that characterized House Stark. He was the father of four children: Brandon (his eldest son and heir), Eddard, Lyanna, and Benjen, raising them in the traditions of the First Men and the Old Gods.

Rickard pursued an ambitious policy of southern alliances, betrothing his heir Brandon to Catelyn Tully of Riverrun and his daughter Lyanna to Robert Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End. These arrangements were part of a broader strategy to connect House Stark with the great houses south of the Neck, breaking with the North's traditional isolation. This "Southron Ambitions" policy would have far-reaching consequences for the realm.

Rickard met a horrific end at the hands of the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. When his son Brandon rode to King's Landing to confront Prince Rhaegar over Lyanna's disappearance, both father and son were seized on charges of treason. Rickard demanded trial by combat, but Aerys declared fire to be House Targaryen's champion—Rickard was roasted alive in his armor while Brandon strangled himself trying to save him. Their brutal murders, combined with Aerys's demand for the heads of Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, ignited Robert's Rebellion and ended nearly three centuries of Targaryen rule.
