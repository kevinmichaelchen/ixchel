# Rhaella Targaryen

**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** Queen of the Seven Kingdoms

Rhaella Targaryen was the sister-wife and queen consort of King Aerys II Targaryen, the Mad King, serving as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms during the final years of Targaryen rule. Born into House Targaryen, she was married to her brother Aerys in accordance with the family tradition of incestuous unions meant to preserve the purity of Valyrian bloodlines. Their union was not a happy one—Rhaella endured her husband's growing madness and cruelty throughout their marriage.

Rhaella's life was marked by profound tragedy. She experienced numerous difficult pregnancies, with many children dying in infancy or being stillborn. Only three of her children survived: Prince Rhaegar, the heir to the throne; Prince Viserys; and Princess Daenerys. She watched helplessly as Aerys's paranoia and instability tore the realm apart and brought House Targaryen to the brink of destruction.

As Robert's Rebellion raged and King's Landing fell to the rebels, Rhaella fled to Dragonstone with young Viserys while heavily pregnant. She died in 283 AC on that ancestral Targaryen stronghold during a terrible storm, giving birth to Daenerys. Her surviving children, Viserys and the newborn Daenerys, were smuggled into exile across the Narrow Sea by loyal retainers, becoming the last known Targaryens until the revelation of Jon Snow's true parentage generations later.
