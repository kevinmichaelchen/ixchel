# Jon Snow

**Alias:** The White Wolf
**House:** Stark (raised), Targaryen (by birth)
**Titles:** Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, King in the North

Jon Snow was raised as the illegitimate son of Lord Eddard Stark at Winterfell, though his true parentage—as the son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark—remained hidden for most of his life. Growing up as a bastard in a noble household, Jon faced constant reminders of his outsider status despite the love of his Stark siblings. This drove him to join the Night's Watch, seeking to forge his own identity and purpose beyond the stigma of his birth.

At the Wall, Jon transformed from an arrogant youth into a capable leader. He formed crucial alliances with the Free Folk beyond the Wall, recognizing them as potential allies against the true threat of the White Walkers rather than enemies. Rising through the ranks to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jon made the controversial decision to allow the wildlings through the Wall—a choice that led to his assassination by his own men. He was later resurrected by the red priestess Melisandre, returning from death changed but still committed to protecting the living.

After reclaiming Winterfell from the Boltons with the help of Sansa Stark and the Knights of the Vale, Jon was proclaimed King in the North. He later bent the knee to Daenerys Targaryen to secure her alliance against the Army of the Dead, and discovered his true heritage as Aegon Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne. In the war's aftermath, Jon was forced to kill Daenerys to stop her tyranny, for which he was exiled back to the Wall. He ultimately chose to live among the Free Folk beyond the Wall, accompanied by his loyal direwolf Ghost—the white wolf that had always symbolized his true nature.
