# Lysa Arryn

**House:** Tully (by birth), Arryn (by marriage)
**Titles:** Lady of the Eyrie

Lysa Arryn, born Lysa Tully, was the second daughter of Lord Hoster Tully and the younger sister of Catelyn Stark. Growing up at Riverrun, Lysa was overshadowed by her more beautiful and capable sister, developing deep insecurities that would shape her troubled life. As a young woman, she fell deeply in love with Petyr Baelish, a minor lord's son fostered at Riverrun, but her father had greater ambitions for her than marriage to a penniless boy with no prospects.

When Petyr challenged Brandon Stark to a duel for Catelyn's hand and was gravely wounded, Lysa nursed him back to health. During this time, she gave herself to Petyr and became pregnant with his child—a pregnancy her father forcibly terminated before arranging her marriage to Jon Arryn, the elderly Lord of the Vale. Jon needed Tully support for Robert's Rebellion and accepted the match partly because Lysa had proven she could conceive. The marriage was loveless, and Lysa suffered multiple miscarriages and stillbirths before finally bearing a son, Robert Arryn, whom she raised with smothering overprotection.

Lysa's actions set the entire tragedy of the series in motion. At Petyr Baelish's urging, she poisoned her husband Jon Arryn and sent a letter to her sister Catelyn blaming the Lannisters—the spark that ignited the conflict between the Starks and Lannisters. When war came, she refused to commit the Vale's forces to her nephew Robb's cause, hiding in the Eyrie with her sickly son. She eventually married Petyr, the only man she ever loved, only to be murdered by him when he pushed her through the Moon Door after she threatened Sansa Stark in a fit of jealous rage.
