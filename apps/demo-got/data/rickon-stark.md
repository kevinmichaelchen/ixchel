# Rickon Stark

**House:** Stark

Rickon Stark was the youngest child of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully, born at Winterfell and raised alongside his siblings Robb, Sansa, Arya, and Bran. Like all the Stark children, Rickon bonded with a direwolf pup—his was the wild and fierce Shaggydog, whose untamed nature mirrored Rickon's own temperament. Even as a small child, Rickon displayed the "wolf's blood" that ran through the Stark line, showing a passionate and emotional nature beneath his attempts to appear as brave as his older brothers.

Rickon's childhood was shattered by the war that tore his family apart. He was only three years old when his father left for King's Landing, never to return. The boy struggled to understand why his family kept leaving—first his father, then his mother and brother Robb, then his sisters. When Theon Greyjoy betrayed the Starks and seized Winterfell, Rickon fled with his brother Bran, the wildling woman Osha, and the gentle giant Hodor. The brothers eventually parted ways, with Bran heading north beyond the Wall while Rickon and Osha sought refuge with House Umber at Last Hearth.

Rickon's fate proved tragic. After the death of the Greatjon Umber, his son Smalljon betrayed the young Stark, delivering him to Ramsay Bolton along with Shaggydog's severed head as proof of identity. Ramsay used Rickon as bait to lure Jon Snow into the Battle of the Bastards. In the battle's opening moments, Ramsay released Rickon and told him to run toward Jon, then shot him with arrows as he fled across the field. Rickon died in Jon's arms, the youngest victim of the wars that devastated House Stark—never old enough to understand why his world had been destroyed.
