# Brandon Stark

**Alias:** The Wild Wolf
**House:** Stark
**Titles:** Heir to Winterfell

Brandon Stark, known as "the Wild Wolf," was the eldest son and heir of Lord Rickard Stark and the older brother of Eddard, Lyanna, and Benjen Stark. He embodied the fierce, untamed spirit that the Starks called "wolf's blood"—hot-tempered, bold, and fearless. Brandon was everything a lord's heir was expected to be: tall, handsome, skilled with a sword, and charismatic, though his impulsive nature often led him into trouble.

Brandon was betrothed to Catelyn Tully of Riverrun, a political match that promised to unite two great houses. During this time, young Petyr Baelish, a ward at Riverrun who harbored secret feelings for Catelyn, challenged Brandon to a duel for her hand. Brandon easily defeated the smaller boy but spared his life at Catelyn's plea—an act of mercy that would have unforeseen consequences when Littlefinger later rose to power and manipulated events that destroyed House Stark.

When word reached Brandon that Prince Rhaegar Targaryen had allegedly abducted his sister Lyanna, he rode immediately to King's Landing with a group of companions, demanding Rhaegar come out and die. This rash action proved fatal: the Mad King Aerys II had Brandon and his companions arrested for treason. Summoning their fathers to answer for their sons' crimes, Aerys executed them all. Brandon was forced to watch his father burn alive while he strangled himself with a leather cord, desperately trying to reach a sword placed just out of reach. His death, along with Rickard's, sparked Robert's Rebellion and changed the fate of Westeros forever.
