# Edmure Tully

**House:** Tully
**Titles:** Lord of Riverrun, Lord Paramount of the Trident

Edmure Tully is the only son of Lord Hoster Tully and the younger brother of Catelyn Stark and Lysa Arryn. He inherited his father's seat at Riverrun and the lordship of the Riverlands upon Hoster's death during the War of the Five Kings. Known as hot-headed but good-hearted, Edmure struggled to live up to his father's legacy while the realm burned around him. His genuine concern for the smallfolk of the Riverlands sometimes conflicted with the cold strategic calculus of war.

During the War of the Five Kings, Edmure fought loyally for his nephew Robb Stark, the King in the North. However, his well-intentioned but unauthorized attack on Lannister forces at the Stone Mill inadvertently ruined Robb's plan to lure Tywin Lannister into a trap in the Westerlands. This blunder required appeasement, and Edmure was forced to marry Roslin Frey to repair the alliance with House Frey that Robb had broken by marrying for love. Edmure accepted this duty reluctantly but honorably.

The wedding at the Twins became the Red Wedding, one of the most infamous massacres in Westerosi history. While Edmure was bedding his new bride, Walder Frey's men slaughtered Robb, Catelyn, and thousands of Northern soldiers. Edmure survived only because he was away from the main hall, but he was immediately taken prisoner. He remained a captive for years, used as a hostage to force the surrender of Riverrun. In the end, Edmure survived the wars that destroyed his family, eventually gaining his freedom and—in the show's finale—even putting himself forward as a candidate for king before being dismissed by his own sister Sansa.
