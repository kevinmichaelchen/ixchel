# Renly Baratheon

**House:** Baratheon
**Titles:** Lord of Storm's End, Master of Laws

Renly Baratheon was the youngest of the three Baratheon brothers and the most charismatic, combining Robert's easy charm with political ambition that his brothers lacked. Born in 277 AC to Lord Steffon Baratheon and Lady Cassana Estermont, Renly was only a child when his parents drowned in Shipbreaker Bay. He inherited Storm's End and the Stormlands from Robert after the rebellion, while Stannis was given the lesser seat of Dragonstone—a decision that bred lasting resentment between the brothers.

As Lord of Storm's End and Master of Laws on Robert's small council, Renly cultivated a reputation for generosity and charm that made him beloved throughout the realm. His close relationship with Ser Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers, was an open secret at court, and this connection to House Tyrell would prove politically decisive. When Robert died and the truth about Cersei's children emerged, Renly rejected Stannis's claim despite his elder brother's legal right to the throne. Instead, he declared himself king, arguing that ability and popularity should trump birth order.

Renly's alliance with House Tyrell through his marriage to Margaery Tyrell gave him the largest army in the War of the Five Kings—over one hundred thousand men. His campaign was more a grand procession than a military operation, complete with tournaments and feasts, as he confidently marched toward King's Landing. However, Renly never reached his destination. During a parley with Stannis at Storm's End, he was assassinated by a shadow creature birthed through Melisandre's dark magic. His death scattered his forces, with most of the Tyrells eventually allying with the Lannisters while others joined Stannis. Renly's brief bid for the throne demonstrated that in Westeros, popularity without caution could be as fatal as weakness.
