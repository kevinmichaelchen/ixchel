# Stannis Baratheon

**Alias:** The Mannis
**House:** Baratheon
**Titles:** Lord of Dragonstone, Master of Ships

Stannis Baratheon was the middle brother of King Robert Baratheon and one of the most formidable military commanders in Westeros, known for his iron will, rigid sense of justice, and complete lack of charm. During Robert's Rebellion, Stannis held Storm's End against a year-long siege by the Tyrells, enduring near-starvation until the smuggler Davos Seaworth broke the blockade with a ship full of onions. Stannis rewarded Davos with a knighthood while also cutting off his fingertips as punishment for his years of smuggling—a perfect illustration of his uncompromising nature.

After the rebellion, Robert granted Stannis the ancient Targaryen seat of Dragonstone rather than the ancestral Baratheon castle of Storm's End, which went to the youngest brother Renly. Stannis viewed this as a slight, though Dragonstone's strategic importance was undeniable. He served his brother loyally as Master of Ships, crushing the Greyjoy Rebellion's fleet, but grew increasingly bitter at the lack of recognition for his service. When Jon Arryn began investigating the parentage of Cersei's children, Stannis assisted him and discovered the truth—that Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen were not Robert's children but products of incest.

Upon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself the rightful king, as the true heir with Robert's children being illegitimate. He fell under the influence of Melisandre, a red priestess of R'hllor, whose shadow magic and prophecies of Azor Azhai shaped his campaign. Despite his military brilliance, Stannis suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, where Tyrion Lannister's wildfire destroyed his fleet. He later marched north to aid the Night's Watch against the wildlings, but his desperation led to unconscionable acts—including the sacrifice of his own daughter Shireen to the flames. His campaign ended in failure outside Winterfell, where his depleted, demoralized army was destroyed by the Boltons.
