# Viserys Targaryen

**Alias:** The Beggar King
**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** King of the Andals (self-styled)

Viserys Targaryen, mockingly known as the Beggar King, was the second son of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella, and the older brother of Daenerys Targaryen. Born during the waning years of Targaryen rule, Viserys grew up amid the chaos of Robert's Rebellion and the subsequent collapse of his family's dynasty. After his father's death and the fall of King's Landing, young Viserys fled into exile across the Narrow Sea with his infant sister, living as penniless wanderers dependent on the charity of strangers and Targaryen loyalists.

Viserys earned his derisive nickname through his delusions of royal grandeur despite his impoverished circumstances. Styling himself "King Viserys III," he demanded deference from all he encountered while possessing neither the means nor the strategic ability to reclaim the Iron Throne. His intense entitlement and volatile temper made him increasingly unstable, and he treated his younger sister Daenerys as a bargaining chip rather than family, threatening and abusing her throughout their childhood in exile.

Desperate to fund an army, Viserys arranged Daenerys's marriage to the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo in exchange for the promise of forty thousand warriors. However, among the Dothraki, he failed to understand their customs and repeatedly insulted Drogo, ignoring warnings from Ser Jorah Mormont. His end came when, in a drunken rage, he drew a sword in the sacred city of Vaes Dothrak—violating Dothraki law—and demanded his "golden crown." Drogo fulfilled this demand by pouring molten gold over Viserys's head, killing him instantly. Daenerys, watching her brother die, noted coldly that he was no true dragon, for "fire cannot kill a dragon."
