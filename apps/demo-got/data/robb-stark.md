# Robb Stark

**Alias:** The Young Wolf
**House:** Stark
**Titles:** King in the North

Robb Stark, known as the Young Wolf, was the firstborn son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully and the heir to Winterfell. When his father was executed by King Joffrey Baratheon on false charges of treason, the teenage Robb called his banners and marched south to war. The Northern lords, inspired by his courage and disgusted by Lannister treachery, proclaimed him King in the North—the first since Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror three centuries earlier.

Robb proved himself a military genius despite his youth, winning every battle he fought. He captured the legendary warrior Jaime Lannister at the Whispering Wood, broke the siege of Riverrun, and defeated Lannister forces at Oxcross, earning his fearsome nickname. Legends spread through Westeros of the Young Wolf riding into battle with his direwolf Grey Wind at his side, with rumors claiming he could transform into a wolf and could not be killed. Even Tywin Lannister, the realm's greatest strategist, could not defeat him in the field.

However, Robb's downfall came not through battle but through betrayal. His marriage to Talisa Maegyr (Jeyne Westerling in the books) broke a crucial alliance with House Frey, and his execution of Lord Rickard Karstark cost him half his army. These mistakes gave his enemies the opening they needed. At the Red Wedding, hosted by Walder Frey at the Twins, Robb, his mother Catelyn, his wife, and most of his army were massacred in violation of sacred guest right. The conspiracy, orchestrated by Tywin Lannister with the Freys and Roose Bolton, ended the Northern rebellion and earned Robb the bitter epithet "the King Who Lost the North."
