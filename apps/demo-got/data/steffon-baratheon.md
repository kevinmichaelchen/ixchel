# Steffon Baratheon

**House:** Baratheon
**Titles:** Lord of Storm's End

Steffon Baratheon was the Lord of Storm's End and Lord Paramount of the Stormlands, and the father of Robert, Stannis, and Renly Baratheon. He inherited the lordship after his father Ormund Baratheon was killed during the War of the Ninepenny Kings in 260 AC by Maelys Blackfyre, the last of the Blackfyre Pretenders. Through his grandmother Rhaelle Targaryen, Steffon had royal blood, making him a cousin to King Aerys II Targaryen.

Steffon and Aerys had been childhood friends, and this relationship proved valuable during the turbulent years of the Mad King's reign. Following the Defiance of Duskendale in 277 AC, when Aerys grew increasingly paranoid about his Hand, Tywin Lannister, the king summoned his trusted cousin to court and appointed him to the small council. Steffon served as a stabilizing influence during a period when Aerys's mental state was deteriorating.

Steffon's life ended in tragedy during a return voyage from court. His ship, the Windproud, was caught in a terrible storm and wrecked upon the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay—the treacherous waters that surrounded Storm's End. Steffon, his wife Cassana, and hundreds of sailors drowned in the disaster, which occurred in full view of his sons Robert and Stannis watching helplessly from the castle walls. The only survivor was the court fool Patchface, who washed ashore three days later, his mind shattered by the experience. Steffon's death left his eldest son Robert as the new Lord of Storm's End, setting the stage for the rebellion that would reshape Westeros.
