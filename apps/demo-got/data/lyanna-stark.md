# Lyanna Stark

**Alias:** The She-Wolf
**House:** Stark

Lyanna Stark, known as the "She-Wolf" of Winterfell, was the only daughter of Lord Rickard Stark and the younger sister of Brandon, Eddard, and Benjen. She embodied the fierce, independent spirit that the Starks called "wolf's blood"—skilled in horseback riding and swordsmanship, she defied the traditional expectations placed upon noblewomen in Westeros. Beautiful with dark hair and pale skin, Lyanna was as wild and untamed as the North itself.

At the Tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC, Lyanna's true nature was revealed when she secretly competed as the mysterious "Knight of the Laughing Tree," defending her father's bannerman Howland Reed from bullying squires. Her actions drew the attention of Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, who won the tournament and shocked the realm by crowning Lyanna the queen of love and beauty instead of his own wife, Princess Elia Martell. Though betrothed to Robert Baratheon, Lyanna harbored doubts about the match, confiding to her brother Ned that Robert would never keep to one bed.

In 282 AC, Lyanna disappeared with Rhaegar in what Robert called an abduction but was likely an elopement born of love. This act sparked Robert's Rebellion and led to the deaths of her father and brother Brandon at the hands of the Mad King. Lyanna died at the Tower of Joy in Dorne, shortly after giving birth to a son fathered by Rhaegar. In her final moments, she made her brother Ned promise to protect the infant—a promise he kept by raising the child as his bastard, Jon Snow, hiding his true identity as Aegon Targaryen from a world that would have killed him.
