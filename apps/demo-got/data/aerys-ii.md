# Aerys II Targaryen

**Alias:** The Mad King
**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** King of the Andals and the First Men

Aerys II Targaryen, infamously known as the Mad King, was the last Targaryen ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, reigning from 262 AC until his death in 283 AC. Born to King Jaehaerys II Targaryen and his sister-wife Shaera, Aerys showed early promise as a charming, generous, and ambitious young prince. He earned his knighthood at sixteen while fighting in the War of the Ninepenny Kings on the Stepstones, where he forged a close friendship with Tywin Lannister, whom he would later appoint as his Hand of the King.

The early years of Aerys's reign were marked by grand ambitions and active rule, but his mental state deteriorated progressively over time—a consequence, many believed, of the Targaryen tradition of incestuous marriage. The Defiance of Duskendale in 277 AC proved a turning point: held captive for months by Lord Denys Darklyn, Aerys emerged paranoid and vengeful, executing House Darklyn entirely. His obsession with fire grew, leading him to favor pyromancers and burn enemies alive, while his relationship with Tywin soured irreparably.

Aerys's madness culminated in the events that sparked Robert's Rebellion. When his son Rhaegar allegedly abducted Lyanna Stark, Aerys brutally executed her father Rickard and brother Brandon by fire. His final command was to "burn them all"—ordering the destruction of King's Landing with wildfire caches hidden throughout the city. He was slain by his own Kingsguard, Ser Jaime Lannister, who became known as the Kingslayer. Aerys left behind three surviving children: Rhaegar (who died at the Trident), Viserys, and Daenerys, born posthumously during the fall of the dynasty.
