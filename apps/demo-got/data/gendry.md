# Gendry

**Alias:** Gendry Waters (formerly)
**House:** Baratheon
**Titles:** Lord of Storm's End

Gendry is the unacknowledged bastard son of King Robert Baratheon, raised in complete ignorance of his royal heritage as a blacksmith's apprentice in the slums of King's Landing. With his dark hair, blue eyes, and powerful build, Gendry bore an unmistakable resemblance to Robert in his youth—a resemblance that helped Eddard Stark uncover the truth about Cersei's children, whose blond hair proved they could not be Robert's trueborn heirs.

After Robert's death, Queen Cersei ordered the execution of all the late king's bastards to eliminate any challenges to Joffrey's claim. Gendry escaped King's Landing among a group of Night's Watch recruits gathered by Yoren, traveling alongside Arya Stark, who was disguised as a boy. Their journey north was interrupted when Lannister forces captured them, and Gendry's blacksmithing skills saved his life when he was put to work at Harrenhal. He later joined the Brotherhood Without Banners and was knighted by Beric Dondarrion, though his path eventually led him back to King's Landing, where he worked in anonymity as a smith.

Gendry's fortunes changed dramatically during the final wars. He joined Jon Snow's expedition beyond the Wall to capture a wight, proving himself a capable fighter. After the defeat of the Night King, Daenerys Targaryen legitimized him as Gendry Baratheon and named him Lord of Storm's End, restoring House Baratheon in a single stroke. He proposed marriage to Arya Stark, with whom he had developed a deep connection, but she declined—Arya was not meant for the life of a lady. Gendry thus became the last Baratheon, inheriting his father's castle and titles while embodying the resilience of a house that nearly went extinct.
