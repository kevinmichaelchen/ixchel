# Aegon I Targaryen

**Alias:** The Conqueror
**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

Aegon I Targaryen, known as Aegon the Conqueror, was the founder of the Targaryen dynasty and the first King of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Hailing from Dragonstone, the last remnant of the Valyrian Freehold, he launched his conquest around 2 BC, toppling ancient houses and forging a unified realm through fire and blood. Riding his fearsome dragon Balerion the Black Dread, alongside his sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys on their dragons Vhagar and Meraxes, Aegon burned Harrenhal and secured the submission of most Westerosi kingdoms.

Aegon united the Riverlands, Stormlands, the Reach, and other regions through a combination of decisive battles and strategic submissions. However, Dorne remained stubbornly independent, resisting Targaryen rule for generations. His conquest was not merely military but also diplomatic—he installed loyal houses in positions of power and established King's Landing as the new capital of the realm.

Ruling until his death in 37 AC, Aegon shaped nearly three centuries of Targaryen dominion. He groomed his sons Aenys and Maegor for succession, wore an iconic iron-and-ruby crown, and consolidated power amid rebellions from the Iron Islands and the Three Sisters. His legacy includes the forging of the Iron Throne from the swords of his defeated enemies and a prophetic dream of the Long Night that he passed down through generations of his descendants.
