# Sansa Stark

**House:** Stark
**Titles:** Queen in the North, Lady of Winterfell

Sansa Stark is the eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully, and one of the few characters whose arc spans the entire saga from naive girl to powerful queen. As a child in Winterfell, Sansa dreamed of knights, princes, and courtly romance, embodying the idealistic vision of a perfect lady. Her betrothal to Prince Joffrey Baratheon seemed like a fairy tale come true—until the brutal realities of King's Landing shattered her illusions forever.

After her father's execution, Sansa became a hostage of the Lannisters, enduring years of psychological and physical abuse at the hands of Joffrey and Cersei while learning to survive through courtesy and cunning. Forcibly married to Tyrion Lannister to secure Winterfell's inheritance, she later escaped King's Landing with the help of Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish. Her subsequent marriage to the sadistic Ramsay Bolton brought even greater suffering, but Sansa endured, eventually escaping during the chaos of the Battle of the Bastards.

Reunited with her half-brother Jon Snow, Sansa helped reclaim Winterfell from the Boltons and proved instrumental in securing the Knights of the Vale for their cause. She executed Littlefinger after exposing his decades of manipulation and treachery, demonstrating how far she had come from the naive girl who once trusted such men. Throughout the wars against the Night King and Daenerys Targaryen, Sansa remained focused on Northern independence. When her brother Bran was chosen as King of the Six Kingdoms, Sansa successfully negotiated the North's independence, becoming Queen in the North—a ruler forged by trauma into wisdom, ruling Winterfell with the hard-won knowledge that "the North remembers."
