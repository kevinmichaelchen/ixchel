# Eddard Stark

**Alias:** Ned
**House:** Stark
**Titles:** Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King

Eddard "Ned" Stark was the Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, and one of the most honorable men in the Seven Kingdoms. The second son of Lord Rickard Stark, Ned was fostered at the Eyrie alongside Robert Baratheon under Lord Jon Arryn, forging a brotherhood that would shape the realm's future. When the Mad King Aerys II murdered his father and brother, Ned was thrust into leadership of House Stark and became a key figure in Robert's Rebellion.

After the war, Ned returned to Winterfell with a mysterious infant he claimed as his bastard son, Jon Snow—in truth, the child of his sister Lyanna and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, whose identity he protected at the cost of his own honor. He married Catelyn Tully, his brother Brandon's former betrothed, and together they raised five children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon. Ned ruled the North justly for nearly two decades, earning a reputation for unwavering integrity and stern but fair leadership.

When King Robert summoned Ned to serve as Hand of the King following Jon Arryn's suspicious death, duty compelled him to leave Winterfell despite his reluctance. In King's Landing, Ned uncovered the truth that Queen Cersei's children were born of incest with her brother Jaime, making them illegitimate. His rigid honor proved his undoing: he warned Cersei of his discovery and trusted the treacherous Littlefinger, who betrayed him to the Lannisters. Arrested for treason after Robert's death, Ned falsely confessed to save his daughters, expecting exile to the Night's Watch. Instead, the cruel boy-king Joffrey ordered his execution, and Ned Stark was beheaded on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor—a death that ignited the War of the Five Kings.
