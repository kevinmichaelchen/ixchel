# Bran Stark

**Alias:** Bran the Broken
**House:** Stark
**Titles:** King of the Six Kingdoms, The Three-Eyed Raven

Brandon "Bran" Stark is the second son of Lord Eddard Stark and Lady Catelyn Tully, whose life was forever altered when he was pushed from a tower window by Jaime Lannister after witnessing the knight's incestuous relationship with Queen Cersei. The fall left Bran paralyzed from the waist down, ending his dreams of becoming a knight. Yet this tragedy awakened something far more extraordinary within him—the gift of greensight and the ability to warg into animals and even other people.

Following visions of a three-eyed raven, Bran embarked on a perilous journey beyond the Wall with the wildling Osha, his brother Rickon, Hodor, and the Reed siblings Meera and Jojen. They eventually reached a hidden cave where Bran met the Three-Eyed Raven, an ancient greenseer who had been watching him. Under the Raven's tutelage, Bran learned to master his abilities, gaining access to the memories of all human history. However, his reckless use of these powers allowed the Night King to locate the cave, resulting in the deaths of the Three-Eyed Raven, Hodor, Summer the direwolf, and the Children of the Forest.

Bran emerged as the new Three-Eyed Raven, transformed into something more than human—possessed of vast knowledge but stripped of much of his former personality and emotion. He revealed Jon Snow's true parentage as Aegon Targaryen, information that ultimately contributed to Daenerys's downfall. In the aftermath of the wars, the lords of Westeros chose Bran as King of the Six Kingdoms, reasoning that the realm should be ruled by its living memory. As King Bran the Broken, he represents a new kind of ruler—one chosen for wisdom rather than blood or conquest, though the North remained independent under his sister Sansa's rule.
