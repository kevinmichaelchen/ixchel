# Hoster Tully

**House:** Tully
**Titles:** Lord of Riverrun, Lord Paramount of the Trident

Hoster Tully was the Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident, ruling over the strategically vital Riverlands from his ancestral seat at the junction of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone rivers. A strong and stubborn leader in his prime, Hoster was known for his political acumen and the shrewd alliances he forged to elevate House Tully's standing among the great houses of Westeros. He secured the loyalty of his bannermen—Houses Mallister, Vance, Bracken, Blackwood, and the treacherous Freys—through a combination of fair governance and strategic marriages.

Hoster's greatest political achievement was the double wedding he arranged during Robert's Rebellion. When Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark raised their banners against the Mad King, Hoster joined their cause by wedding his daughter Catelyn to Ned Stark and his daughter Lysa to Jon Arryn. These marriages bound three great houses together in common cause and elevated House Tully from regional lords to players in the highest circles of Westerosi politics. His only son, Edmure, inherited his hot temper but not always his strategic sense.

By the time of the War of the Five Kings, Hoster was an elderly, bedridden invalid, slowly dying of a wasting illness while his family's world collapsed around him. He passed away without witnessing the full horror of the Red Wedding, which saw his grandson Robb Stark murdered, his daughter Catelyn's throat cut, and House Tully stripped of their lands and titles. His legacy lived on through his grandchildren—Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark—and in the Tully words that defined his life: "Family, Duty, Honor."
