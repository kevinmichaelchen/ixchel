# Benjen Stark

**House:** Stark
**Titles:** First Ranger of the Night's Watch

Benjen Stark was the youngest son of Lord Rickard Stark and the brother of Brandon, Eddard, and Lyanna. After Robert's Rebellion claimed the lives of his father, elder brother, and sister, Benjen chose to take the black and join the Night's Watch, rising through the ranks to become First Ranger—the most respected scout and leader of ranging parties beyond the Wall. His reasons for joining remain mysterious, with some speculating guilt over his role in events at the Tourney at Harrenhal or knowledge of his sister Lyanna's secrets.

At Castle Black, Benjen became a respected figure known for his skill, courage, and dedication to the Watch's ancient mission. When his nephew Jon Snow arrived at the Wall, Benjen served as both mentor and warning, honestly telling the boy about the harsh realities of the Night's Watch while supporting his decision to join. He defended the Night's Watch deserter Gared, executed by Ned Stark, noting that a loyal man would not flee without grave cause—perhaps hinting at knowledge of the White Walker threat.

Benjen disappeared during a ranging beyond the Wall, and his fate became one of the great mysteries of the story. Search parties found only the reanimated corpses of his companions, who attacked Castle Black as wights before being destroyed. In the television series, Benjen reappeared years later as a mysterious, undead-like figure who rescued both Bran Stark and Jon Snow from wights beyond the Wall, sacrificing himself to allow Jon to escape. His ultimate fate in the books remains unknown, with theories connecting him to the enigmatic figure known as Coldhands.
