# Cersei Lannister

**House:** Lannister
**Titles:** Queen of the Seven Kingdoms

Cersei Lannister was the eldest child of Tywin Lannister, twin sister of Jaime Lannister, and older sister of Tyrion Lannister. Famed for her golden beauty and ruthless ambition, Cersei was raised at Casterly Rock with expectations of greatness—she once hoped to marry Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, but Robert's Rebellion changed her fate. Instead, she was wed to the new king, Robert Baratheon, in a political match that bound House Lannister to the crown. The marriage was loveless from the start; Robert called her "Lyanna" on their wedding night, and Cersei never forgave him.

Throughout her marriage, Cersei conducted a secret incestuous affair with her twin brother Jaime, bearing three children—Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen—whom she passed off as Robert's legitimate heirs. When young Bran Stark discovered them together, Jaime pushed him from a tower, setting off the chain of events that would engulf the realm in war. After Robert's death—hastened by Cersei's scheme to have him drink strongwine during a boar hunt—she ruled as Queen Regent, manipulating her son Joffrey and later Tommen while eliminating threats to Lannister power.

Cersei's paranoia and cruelty intensified as her children died one by one and her enemies multiplied. Imprisoned and humiliated by the Faith Militant, she took devastating revenge by destroying the Great Sept of Baelor with wildfire, killing hundreds including the High Sparrow, Margaery Tyrell, and much of the court. She then crowned herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, the first woman to rule Westeros in her own right. Her reign was marked by isolation and madness, trusting only herself as she alienated Jaime and refused to honor her pledge to fight the Army of the Dead. Cersei died in the collapsing Red Keep during Daenerys Targaryen's assault on King's Landing, crushed in Jaime's arms as the world they had built together came crashing down.
