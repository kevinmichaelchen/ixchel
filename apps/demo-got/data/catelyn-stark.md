# Catelyn Stark

**House:** Tully (by birth), Stark (by marriage)
**Titles:** Lady of Winterfell

Catelyn Stark, born Catelyn Tully, was the eldest daughter of Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun and the Lady of Winterfell through her marriage to Eddard Stark. Raised in the Faith of the Seven at Riverrun, she was strong, intelligent, proud, and fiercely devoted to her family. Originally betrothed to Ned's elder brother Brandon, she married Ned instead after Brandon's murder by the Mad King, their union sealed in a double ceremony alongside her sister Lysa's marriage to Jon Arryn during Robert's Rebellion.

As Lady of Winterfell, Catelyn proved herself a capable partner to Ned, managing the household and raising their five children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon. Her one blind spot was Jon Snow, her husband's supposed bastard, whom she resented as a living reminder of what she believed was Ned's infidelity. She never knew that Jon was actually her husband's nephew, the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, a secret Ned kept even from her to protect the child.

When Bran was pushed from a tower and an assassin attempted to kill him, Catelyn's investigation led her to suspect Lannister involvement, setting in motion a chain of events that contributed to the War of the Five Kings. She served as a key advisor to her son Robb during his campaign as King in the North, though her decision to free the captive Jaime Lannister in hopes of recovering her daughters caused a rift. Catelyn's story ended tragically at the Red Wedding, where she witnessed Robb's murder by their treacherous hosts, the Freys, before her own throat was cut. In the books, she is resurrected as the vengeful Lady Stoneheart, though this arc was not adapted for television.
