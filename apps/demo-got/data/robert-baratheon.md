# Robert Baratheon

**Alias:** The Usurper
**House:** Baratheon
**Titles:** King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

Robert Baratheon, called "the Demon of the Trident" by his admirers and "the Usurper" by Targaryen loyalists, was the seventeenth King of the Andals and the First Men, who seized the Iron Throne through conquest after leading a successful rebellion against the Mad King Aerys II. In his prime, Robert was a towering warrior of legendary strength, wielding a massive warhammer that crushed all who stood against him. Fostered at the Eyrie alongside Eddard Stark under Lord Jon Arryn, Robert formed the bonds of friendship that would later forge a rebellion.

Robert's Rebellion was sparked by his love for Lyanna Stark, his betrothed, who was allegedly abducted by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. When the Mad King murdered Ned's father and brother and demanded the heads of Robert and Ned, Jon Arryn raised his banners in revolt. Robert personally slew Rhaegar in single combat at the Battle of the Trident, scattering rubies from the prince's breastplate into the river. With the Targaryens overthrown and Aerys dead at Jaime Lannister's hand, Robert claimed the throne through his distant Targaryen ancestry and right of conquest.

As king, Robert proved far better at war than governance. He married Cersei Lannister to cement the alliance with Tywin, though their union was loveless and produced no true heirs—unknown to Robert, his supposed children Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen were actually born of Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother Jaime. Robert grew fat and dissolute, preferring hunting and drinking to ruling, leaving the realm's administration to others while accumulating massive debts. He died after being gored by a boar during a hunt—a death engineered by Cersei, who had his wine strengthened. His passing ignited the War of the Five Kings, as the truth about his "heirs" and the ambitions of his brothers tore the realm apart.
