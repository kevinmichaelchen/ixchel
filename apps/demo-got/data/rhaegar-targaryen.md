# Rhaegar Targaryen

**Alias:** The Last Dragon
**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** Crown Prince of the Seven Kingdoms

Rhaegar Targaryen was the eldest son of King Aerys II and Queen Rhaella, born in 259 AC at Summerhall during the tragic fire that claimed his great-grandfather Aegon V. Known as "the Last Dragon" for his melancholic nature and exceptional abilities, Rhaegar was renowned as a skilled warrior, scholar, and musician. He was beloved by the smallfolk for his charisma, honor, and intelligence, though he was haunted by prophecies of the Prince That Was Promised, which he initially believed applied to himself or his children.

Rhaegar's fate was sealed at the Tourney at Harrenhal, where he won the joust by defeating champions like Ser Arthur Dayne. In a scandalous breach of protocol, he crowned Lyanna Stark—betrothed to Robert Baratheon—as the queen of love and beauty, bypassing his own wife, Princess Elia Martell. Eddard Stark would later recall this as the moment "when all the smiles died." In 282 AC, Rhaegar disappeared with Lyanna, an act perceived as abduction that ignited Robert's Rebellion and brought ruin to House Targaryen.

Rhaegar met his end at the Battle of the Trident in 283 AC, slain in single combat by Robert Baratheon at the ruby ford. His body was cremated according to Targaryen tradition, and his ashes scattered in the river. The truth of his relationship with Lyanna—that they had secretly married and produced a son, Jon Snow—would remain hidden for decades. Rhaegar's actions, driven by prophecy and love, ultimately doomed his house but also ensured the survival of his bloodline through the child raised as Ned Stark's bastard.
