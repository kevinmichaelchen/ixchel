# Daenerys Targaryen

**Alias:** Stormborn
**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains

Daenerys Targaryen, called Stormborn for the great tempest that raged during her birth on Dragonstone, was the youngest child of King Aerys II and Queen Rhaella and one of the most transformative figures in Westerosi history. Born in 284 AC as her mother died in childbirth and the Targaryen dynasty crumbled, Daenerys spent her childhood in exile across the Narrow Sea, living in poverty and fear under the control of her abusive brother Viserys, who sought to use her as a pawn to reclaim the Iron Throne.

Daenerys's journey from frightened exile to powerful conqueror is one of the most dramatic character arcs in the saga. Married against her will to the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, she gradually found her strength and emerged as a leader in her own right. After Drogo's death, she walked into his funeral pyre and emerged unburned with three newly hatched dragons—the first seen in the world for over a century. As the Mother of Dragons, she liberated slave cities across Essos, earning titles like "Breaker of Chains" and "Mhysa" (Mother), while building an army of Unsullied soldiers and Dothraki warriors.

Daenerys's eventual return to Westeros to claim her birthright brought both hope and devastation. Though she allied with Jon Snow and fought against the Army of the Dead, her quest for the Iron Throne ended in tragedy. Driven to madness by loss and betrayal, she burned King's Landing and its innocent inhabitants with her dragon Drogon. Her reign lasted only days before Jon Snow, her nephew and lover, assassinated her in the throne room. Drogon melted the Iron Throne with dragonfire and carried her body east, ending the Targaryen claim to power.
