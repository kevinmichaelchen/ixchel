# Shireen Baratheon

**House:** Baratheon
**Titles:** Princess

Shireen Baratheon was the only surviving child of Lord Stannis Baratheon and Lady Selyse Florent, born in 289 AC on the island fortress of Dragonstone. As an infant, Shireen contracted greyscale, a dreaded disease that turns flesh to stone and is usually fatal. Though she survived, the illness left half her face disfigured with grey, cracked skin—a mark that made her mother view her with barely concealed revulsion while her father, despite his cold demeanor, showed her what affection he could.

Despite her isolated upbringing and the stigma of her disfigurement, Shireen grew into a kind, gentle, and remarkably intelligent young girl. She found solace in books and learning, developing a curious mind that delighted in stories and knowledge. Her friendship with Davos Seaworth, her father's Hand, was particularly meaningful—she taught the former smuggler to read, and he treated her with genuine warmth that was rare in her lonely life. In a world of cruelty and ambition, Shireen represented innocence and hope.

Shireen's story ended in one of the most tragic moments in the entire saga. During Stannis's desperate campaign to take Winterfell from the Boltons, his army became trapped by winter storms, facing starvation and desertion. Convinced by the red priestess Melisandre that sacrificing royal blood to the Lord of Light would ensure victory, Stannis made the unthinkable choice to burn his own daughter at the stake. Shireen's screams as the flames consumed her remain one of the most haunting moments in the story—a testament to the terrible cost of ambition and fanaticism, and the corruption of a man who believed himself righteous.
