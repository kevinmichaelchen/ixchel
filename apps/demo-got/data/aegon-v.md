# Aegon V Targaryen

**Alias:** Egg
**House:** Targaryen
**Titles:** King of the Andals and the First Men

Aegon V Targaryen, affectionately known as "Egg," was the fifth Targaryen king of Westeros and one of the most beloved yet tragic rulers in the realm's history. As a young prince, he served as a humble squire to the hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall, traveling incognito across Westeros during the events chronicled in "The Tales of Dunk and Egg." This unusual upbringing exposed him to the lives of common folk and instilled in him a deep compassion for those outside the nobility that would define his reign.

Despite being the fourth son of a fourth son, Aegon unexpectedly ascended to the throne after his older brothers were passed over due to various circumstances. As king, he became a champion of the smallfolk, implementing progressive laws that protected commoners—often at the expense of noble lords' power and privilege. This made him a nontraditional ruler, though many lords resented him for his humble origins and reformist agenda. He married Betha Blackwood for love and discouraged the Targaryen tradition of incestuous marriage within the family.

Aegon V's reign ended in tragedy at Summerhall in 259 AC, when he attempted to hatch a dragon egg through mysterious rituals. The resulting fire destroyed the castle and killed many, including Aegon himself. Despite this catastrophic end, his legacy endured through his descendants—he was the great-grandfather of Daenerys Targaryen and great-great-grandfather of Jon Snow, and his companion Ser Duncan the Tall became Lord Commander of his Kingsguard.
