## Summary

Make it easy to ingest, cache, and semantically search “project-adjacent docs”
(RFCs, vendor docs, internal markdown notes) in a git-first way, with citations
that can be linked into decisions/issues.

## Notes

- Source of truth stays Markdown (tracked in git where it makes sense).
- Rebuildable cache (vectors/indices) lives under `.ixchel/data/` and/or
  `~/.ixchel/data/` depending on scope.
- Output should integrate with Ixchel entities: `source` and `citation` nodes,
  with chunk-level provenance for “why was this retrieved?”.
