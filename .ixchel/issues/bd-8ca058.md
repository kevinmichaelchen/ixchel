The --ephemeral and --include-ephemeral flags exist in CLI but are completely ignored. Since ephemeral issues require HelixDB (not file storage), we should either: (1) remove the flags until HelixDB is implemented, or (2) add a clear error message. Current behavior is confusing - flag is accepted silently but does nothing.
