Replace the 3D Threlte-based task graph visualization with Svelte Flow (@xyflow/svelte) for better 2D graph editing capabilities.

## Changes Made

- Replaced Threlte (Three.js) with Svelte Flow for graph rendering
- Added Dagre (@dagrejs/dagre) for hierarchical layout
- Created custom TaskNode component with industrial/terminal aesthetic
- Created custom DependencyEdge with animated flow effects
- Replaced Bits UI with native HTML/CSS alternatives
- Removed unused 3D dependencies

## Dependencies Changed

Added: @xyflow/svelte, @dagrejs/dagre
Removed: @threlte/core, @threlte/extras, three, d3-force-3d, bits-ui

Closed as obsolete: This pivot was completed but is now being superseded by a new architecture using shadcn-svelte + TanStack (see ADR-001). SvelteFlow will be removed in bd-c0a351.
