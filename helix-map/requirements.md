# Requirements

This document defines user stories and acceptance criteria for `helix-map` using
[EARS notation][ears] (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

[ears]: https://www.iaria.org/conferences2013/filesICCGI13/ICCGI_2013_Tutorial_Terzakis.pdf

## Scope Boundaries

`helix-map` is a codebase mapping tool. It focuses on structural context and
directionality (what exists, how it connects, and what is important) without
judging code quality or enforcing policy.

Out of scope for this project:

- Linting, code style rules, or prescriptive quality warnings
- Security scanning or compliance enforcement
- Automated remediation or refactoring suggestions
