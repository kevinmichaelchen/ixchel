**Document:** requirements.md\
**Status:** In Progress (2026-01-06)\
**Author:** Kevin Chen

> **Implementation Status:**
>
> - **Phase 1-2:** Complete — HelixDB storage with fastembed
> - **Phase 3 (Planned):** Incremental indexing + daemonized sync for sub-50ms delta sync

## Vision

helix-decisions is **general decision graph infrastructure** with semantic search. Unlike ADR-specific tools, it treats decisions as first-class graph nodes with relationships, enabling powerful queries about architectural evolution.

## User Stories

### For Agents

```
As an AI agent building context for a task,
I want to search for relevant decisions quickly,
So that I can understand the design constraints and avoid conflicts.
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `helix-decisions search "database migration" --json` returns ranked results in < 100ms
- Output includes: id, uuid, title, status, score, tags, date, deciders
- Semantic search (not just keyword matching)
- Works offline (no external API calls)

### For Developers

```
As a developer,
I want to quickly find past architectural decisions from the terminal,
So that I can reference the reasoning behind design choices.
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `helix-decisions search "caching"` returns human-readable results
- Can filter by status: `helix-decisions search "caching" --status accepted`
- First run indexes all decisions (~2-5s), subsequent runs are fast
- Works in any repo with `.decisions/` directory

### For Decision Lineage

```
As an architect,
I want to trace how decisions evolved over time,
So that I can understand why current decisions exist.
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `helix-decisions chain 5` shows supersedes chain from decision 5
- `helix-decisions related 3` shows all connected decisions
- Graph traversal is fast (< 50ms)

### For CI/Automation

```
As a CI pipeline,
I want to verify that relevant decisions exist before deployment,
So that deployments align with architectural decisions.
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `helix-decisions search "deployment strategy" --limit 1` exits 0 if found, 1 if not
- Works with shell pipelines

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Load Decisions from Filesystem

- **Input:** Directory path (default: `.decisions/`)
- **Output:** Parsed Decision objects with metadata
- **Requirements:**
  - Support markdown files: `NNN-title-kebab-case.md`
  - Parse YAML frontmatter (id, uuid, title, status, date, deciders, tags, relationships)
  - Extract body text for embedding
  - Handle missing/malformed files gracefully

### FR-2: Index into HelixDB

- **Input:** Parsed decisions
- **Output:** Persistent vector index in project-local `.helix/data/decisions/`
- **Requirements:**
  - Embed each decision body using fastembed (CPU)
  - Store embeddings + metadata in HelixDB
  - Create graph edges for relationships
  - Create index on first run (~2-5s for 100 decisions)
  - HelixDB persists across invocations
  - Reuse persisted embeddings when content hash and model are unchanged

### FR-3: Delta Indexing

- **Input:** Current decisions directory
- **Output:** Updated HelixDB index
- **Requirements:**
  - Track file hashes to detect changes
  - Re-index only changed/new decisions
  - Remove deleted decisions from index
  - Detect renames via content hash + uuid and update path without re-embed
  - If uuid is missing, treat rename as delete + add
  - Execute in < 100ms for typical case (no changes)

### FR-4: Semantic Search

- **Input:** Query string
- **Output:** Ranked decisions with scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Requirements:**
  - Embed query using same model as decisions
  - Search HelixDB for nearest neighbors
  - Return top-K results sorted by score
  - Execute in < 50ms

### FR-5: Metadata Filtering

- **Input:** Status and/or tags
- **Output:** Filtered ranked results
- **Requirements:**
  - Filter by status: `--status accepted`
  - Filter by tags: `--tags database,api`
  - Combine filters with AND logic

### FR-6: Graph Traversal

- **Input:** Decision ID
- **Output:** Related decisions via graph edges
- **Requirements:**
  - `chain <id>`: Follow supersedes edges to find evolution
  - `related <id>`: Find all connected decisions (1-hop)
  - Return relationship type with each result

### FR-7: Output Formatting

- **Input:** Search/query results
- **Output:** Formatted text (pretty or JSON)
- **Requirements:**
  - Pretty: Human-readable with colors
  - JSON: Machine-readable with full metadata
  - Default: Pretty if terminal, JSON if piped

### FR-8: CLI Interface

- **Requirements:**
  - Commands: `search`, `chain`, `related`
  - Global options: `--directory`, `--json`
  - Search options: `--limit`, `--status`, `--tags`
  - Help: `helix-decisions --help`

### FR-11: Validation (Lint/Check)

- **Input:** Decisions directory
- **Output:** Validation report + exit code
- **Requirements:**
  - `helix-decisions check` SHALL fail when frontmatter is missing or invalid
  - `helix-decisions check` SHALL fail when `uuid` is missing
  - Git hooks MAY invoke `helix-decisions check` to enforce uuid presence

### FR-9: Incremental Indexing (Phase 3)

- **Input:** Git working tree state + manifest of indexed decisions
- **Output:** Minimal set of re-indexing operations
- **Requirements:**
  - **Stage 1 - Git Detection:** Use `gix` to detect changed files since last indexed commit
  - **Stage 2 - Manifest Comparison:** Compare file content hashes against stored manifest
  - **Stage 3 - Vector Sync:** Re-embed only changed content, tombstone deleted decisions
  - Skip re-embedding when only metadata changed (frontmatter without body change)
  - Track `git_commit` of last full index for baseline comparison
  - Handle force-pushes and rebases gracefully (fall back to full manifest scan)

### FR-10: Indexer Daemon and Consistency

- **Input:** CLI invocation + repo path
- **Output:** Immediate query results + queued background sync
- **Requirements:**
  - A global per-user daemon owns all HelixDB write transactions (single writer)
  - Requests are namespaced by `{repo_root, tool}` to keep data scoped per repo
  - CLI enqueues a "scan + delta sync" request on each invocation
  - CLI uses existing index immediately (eventual consistency)
  - IPC uses local sockets (Unix domain sockets + Windows named pipes)
  - Unix socket path: `~/.helix/run/helixd.sock`
  - Protocol v1 is defined in `shared/helix-daemon/specs/design.md`
  - Provide `--sync` to block until the pending sync completes
  - If the daemon is not running, `--sync` runs a direct sync with a writer lock

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

#### Phase 1-2 — HelixDB Storage

| Operation                   | Target   | Notes                              |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| First search                | 2-5s     | Full indexing                      |
| Subsequent search           | < 200ms  | File hash comparison + search      |
| Delta sync (no changes)     | ~100ms   | Full file scan for hash comparison |
| Delta sync (1 file changed) | ~500ms   | Re-embed + LMDB write              |
| Query embedding             | 50-100ms | fastembed                          |
| Graph traversal             | < 50ms   | In-memory                          |

#### Phase 3 — Native HelixDB

| Operation                   | Target   | Improvement | Notes                    |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| First search                | 2-5s     | Same        | Embedding is bottleneck  |
| Subsequent search           | < 100ms  | 2x faster   | Native HNSW              |
| Delta sync (no changes)     | < 50ms   | 2x faster   | Git-based detection      |
| Delta sync (1 file changed) | < 100ms  | 5x faster   | Incremental graph update |
| Query embedding             | 50-100ms | Same        | fastembed                |
| HelixDB search              | < 20ms   | 2.5x faster | Native vector index      |
| Graph traversal             | < 20ms   | 2.5x faster | Native edge traversal    |

**Phase 3 Key Improvements:**

- **Git-first detection:** Use `gix` to skip unchanged files before hashing
- **Incremental updates:** Update only changed nodes/edges, not full rewrite
- **Native HNSW:** HelixDB's built-in vector index

### Reliability

- Handle missing `.decisions/` gracefully
- Handle malformed YAML (skip with warning)
- Handle deleted decisions (remove from index)
- Prevent concurrent writers across multiple CLI invocations

### Compatibility

- Linux, macOS, Windows
- Works offline
- Embedded HelixDB (no separate setup)

## Data Model

### DecisionMetadata (Required)

```yaml
id: integer           # Local sequential (1, 2, 3...)
uuid: string          # Required for rename optimization; enforced by check/hook
title: string
status: enum          # proposed | accepted | superseded | deprecated
date: date            # YYYY-MM-DD
deciders: [string]
tags: [string]
content_hash: string  # Optional: for immutability proof
git_commit: string    # Optional: commit when accepted
```

### Relationships (Optional)

```yaml
supersedes: integer | [integer]     # Decisions this replaces
amends: integer | [integer]         # Decisions this modifies
depends_on: integer | [integer]     # Prerequisite decisions
related_to: integer | [integer]     # Loosely related decisions
```

### SearchResult

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "uuid": "hx-a1b2c3",
  "title": "Database Migration Strategy",
  "status": "accepted",
  "score": 0.89,
  "tags": ["database", "migration"],
  "date": "2026-01-04",
  "deciders": ["Alice", "Bob"],
  "file_path": ".decisions/003-database-migration-strategy.md"
}
```

## ID Scheme

### Local ID (`id`)

- Sequential integer (1, 2, 3...)
- Human-readable and easy to reference
- Unique within a single repository

### Global UUID (`uuid`)

- Hash-based identifier via helix-id
- Format: `hx-xxxxxx` (6 hex chars from Blake3 hash)
- Safe for distributed collaboration across branches
- Generated from decision content or UUID
- Required for rename optimization; lint/check should enforce presence

## Immutability Model

Decisions become immutable once accepted:

- `content_hash`: SHA-256 of decision content at acceptance
- `git_commit`: Git commit hash when status changed to accepted
- Amendments create new decisions with `amends` relationship
- Superseding creates new decisions with `supersedes` relationship

## CLI Specification
