//! hbd - Git-first issue tracker powered by `HelixDB`
//!
//! A distributed issue tracker designed for AI-supervised coding workflows.
//! Issues are stored as Markdown files in `.tickets/` and synced to `HelixDB`
//! for fast graph traversal, vector search, and BM25 text search.
//!
//! See specs/ for full documentation.
