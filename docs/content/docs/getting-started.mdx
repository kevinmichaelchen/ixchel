# Getting Started

Get up and running with Ixchel Tools in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75+** — For building the tools
- **Git 2.0+** — For version control
- **HelixDB** — Embedded via workspace dependencies (no separate install)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kevinmichaelchen/ixchel-tools.git
cd ixchel-tools

# Build all tools
cargo build --release

# Install ixchel to your PATH
cargo install --path apps/ix-cli
```

## Quick Start with ixchel

Ixchel is the unified CLI for issues, decisions, reports, and more.

### Initialize in Your Project

```bash
cd your-project
ixchel init
```

This creates:
- `.ixchel/` — Canonical Ixchel directory (git-tracked except rebuildable cache)
  - `.ixchel/issues/` — Where issue files are stored
  - `.ixchel/config.toml` — Embeddings + storage configuration
- `.gitignore` entries for `.ixchel/data/` and `.ixchel/models/`

### Create Your First Issue

```bash
ixchel create issue "Add user authentication" --status open
```

### Search Issues

```bash
ixchel search "authentication"
```

### Manage Relationships

```bash
ixchel link iss-abc123 blocks iss-xyz789
ixchel graph iss-abc123
ixchel context iss-abc123
```
