# Getting Started

Get up and running with Helix Tools in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.75+** — For building the tools
- **Git 2.0+** — For version control
- **HelixDB CLI** — The underlying database

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kevinmichaelchen/ixchel-tools.git
cd ixchel-tools

# Build all tools
cargo build --release

# Install hbd to your PATH
cargo install --path hbd
```

## Quick Start with hbd

The issue tracker is the first tool available. Here's how to get started:

### Initialize in Your Project

```bash
cd your-project
hbd init
```

This creates:
- `.ixchel/` — Canonical Ixchel directory (git-tracked except rebuildable cache)
  - `.ixchel/issues/` — Where issue files are stored
  - `.ixchel/config.toml` — Embeddings + storage configuration
- `.gitignore` entries for `.ixchel/data/` and `.ixchel/models/`

### Create Your First Issue

```bash
hbd create "Add user authentication" \
  --description "Implement JWT-based auth flow" \
  --type feature \
  --priority 1
```

### Search Issues

```bash
# Keyword search
hbd search "authentication"

# Semantic search (finds related concepts)
hbd search "login problems" --semantic

# Hybrid search (best of both)
hbd search "user can't sign in" --hybrid
```

### Manage Dependencies

```bash
# Add a dependency
hbd dep add bd-abc123 blocks bd-xyz789

# See what's ready to work on (no blockers)
hbd ready

# See what's blocked and why
hbd blocked
```
