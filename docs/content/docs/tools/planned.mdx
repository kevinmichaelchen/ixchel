# Planned Tools

Beyond `hbd`, we're building a suite of tools for agentic development workflows.
For active tools, see [hbd](/docs/tools/hbd) and [helix-map](/docs/tools/helix-map).

<Callout type="info">
  These tools are in the planning stage. APIs and features may change.
</Callout>

## helix-docs

**Local cache for fetched documentation during agentic research.**

When AI agents research how to use a library, they fetch documentation from the web. This is slow, uses tokens on repeated fetches, and doesn't work offline.

helix-docs will:

- Cache fetched documentation locally
- Index content for semantic search
- Provide fast retrieval for repeated queries
- Work completely offline after initial fetch

```bash
# Fetch and cache documentation
helix-docs fetch https://docs.rs/tokio

# Search cached docs
helix-docs search "async runtime configuration"

# Get context for an LLM
helix-docs context --query "error handling" --limit 2000
```

## helix-mail

**Agent-to-agent messaging and coordination.**

As multi-agent workflows become common, agents need to communicate. helix-mail will provide:

- Asynchronous message passing
- Topic-based routing
- Message persistence
- Integration with hbd issues

```bash
# Send a message
helix-mail send --to agent-b --topic "refactoring" "Starting work on auth module"

# Check messages
helix-mail inbox

# Subscribe to topics
helix-mail subscribe "builds" "deployments"
```
