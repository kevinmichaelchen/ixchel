# Ixchel

**A git-first knowledge weaving system where Markdown is the source of truth.**

Ixchel stores durable knowledge artifacts (decisions, issues, sources, reports) as Markdown files under `.ixchel/`, then builds a **rebuildable** graph + vector index for fast traversal and semantic search.

<Callout type="info">
  Ixchel is currently an MVP. The on-disk format is intentionally simple and
  designed to evolve.
</Callout>

## How It Works

- **Canonical data:** `.ixchel/**/*.md` (git-tracked)
- **Rebuildable cache:** `.ixchel/data/` (gitignored)
- **CLI:** `ixchel` (crate: `ix-cli`)
- **MCP server:** `ixchel-mcp` (crate: `ix-mcp`)

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo install --path ix-cli
cd your-project

ixchel init
ixchel create decision "Use PostgreSQL for primary storage"
ixchel sync
ixchel search "database performance"
```

## Common Commands

### Create and Link

```bash
ixchel create issue "Implement connection pooling"
ixchel link iss-xxxx implements dec-xxxx
```

### Validate

```bash
ixchel check
```

### Graph + Context

```bash
ixchel graph dec-xxxx
ixchel context dec-xxxx
```

## Migration

If you have legacy ADRs in a `.decisions/` directory, migrate them into `.ixchel/decisions/` (keeping Markdown canonical). A built-in migrator is planned; for now, treat this as a one-off scripted/manual conversion.
