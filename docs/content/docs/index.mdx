# Helix Tools

**AI-native developer tools built for the agentic era.**

Modern AI-assisted development needs persistent, structured memory. These tools provide that memory layer using [HelixDB](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db) — the graph-vector database built for RAG and AI applications.

## Why Helix Tools?

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they lack memory. They can't remember what you worked on yesterday, can't find related issues semantically, and can't track dependencies across your codebase.

Helix Tools solves this by giving your AI agents:

- **Semantic Search** — Find issues by meaning, not just keywords
- **Graph Intelligence** — Understand dependencies, blockers, and critical paths
- **Persistent Memory** — Context that survives across sessions
- **Offline-First** — Full functionality without network access

## The Toolkit

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| [**hbd**](/docs/tools/hbd) | Git-first issue tracker with semantic search and dependency graphs | In Development |
| **helix-docs** | Local cache for fetched docs during agentic research | Planned |
| [**helix-map**](/docs/tools/helix-map) | Codebase structure cache for fast exploration | In Development |
| **helix-mail** | Agent-to-agent messaging and coordination | Planned |

## Powered by HelixDB

All tools are built on [HelixDB](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db), which uniquely combines:

- **Graph traversal** — Navigate relationships between entities
- **Vector search** — Find semantically similar content  
- **BM25 text search** — Traditional keyword matching
- **Hybrid reranking** — Combine search methods intelligently

This combination enables features like "find issues similar to this one" or "what's the critical path blocking this epic" that traditional databases simply can't provide.
