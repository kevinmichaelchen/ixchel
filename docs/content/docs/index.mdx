description: AI-native developer tools powered by HelixDB
---

A monorepo of AI-native developer tools powered by [HelixDB](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db) - the graph-vector database built for RAG and AI applications.

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **hbd** | Git-first issue tracker for AI-supervised workflows | In Development |
| **helix-docs** | Local cache for fetched docs during agentic research | Planned |
| **helix-map** | Codebase structure cache for fast exploration | Planned |
| **helix-mail** | Agent-to-agent messaging and coordination | Planned |

## Design Principles

### Git-First

All tools store their data in git-friendly formats (Markdown, YAML, JSONL). HelixDB acts as a fast query cache, not the source of truth.

### Offline-First

Full functionality without network access. Local embeddings via `fastembed` (no Ollama server required). Cloud APIs are optional fallbacks.

### AI-Native

Every tool is designed for AI agent consumption:

- `--json` output on all commands
- Semantic search for context retrieval
- Structured data for LLM prompts
- Agent session tracking

### UNIX Philosophy

Each tool does one thing well. They compose via standard interfaces (stdin/stdout, files, git).
