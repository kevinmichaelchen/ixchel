# Design Principles

Every tool in this collection follows four core principles.

## Git-First

All tools store their data in git-friendly formats — Markdown, YAML, JSONL. The files are human-readable, diff-friendly, and work with your existing git workflow.

**HelixDB acts as a fast query cache, not the source of truth.** 

If you delete the database, you lose nothing. Run `hbd sync` and it rebuilds from your `.ixchel/issues/` files. Your issues live in git, travel with your code, and merge like any other file.

```
.ixchel/issues/
├── bd-a1b2c3.md   ← Human-readable Markdown
├── bd-d4e5f6.md   ← YAML frontmatter + content
└── bd-g7h8i9.md   ← Version controlled in git
```

## Offline-First

Full functionality without network access. No cloud service required. No API keys needed.

- **Local embeddings** via `fastembed` — The BGE-small model runs natively in Rust
- **Local database** via HelixDB/LMDB — Everything on your machine
- **Cloud APIs are optional fallbacks** — Use them if you want, but never required

This means you can work on a plane, in a coffee shop with spotty WiFi, or in an air-gapped environment. Your tools work everywhere your code does.

## AI-Native

Every tool is designed for AI agent consumption first, human consumption second.

- **`--json` output** on all commands for structured parsing
- **Semantic search** for intelligent context retrieval
- **Agent tracking** via `--agent` and `--session` flags
- **Token-aware context** with `hbd context --limit <tokens>`

When an AI assistant asks "what issues are related to authentication?", it can get a semantically-relevant answer — not just keyword matches.

```bash
# Perfect for AI agents
hbd context --query "authentication" --limit 4000 --json
```

## UNIX Philosophy

Each tool does one thing well. They compose via standard interfaces.

| Tool | Single Purpose |
|------|---------------|
| `hbd` | Track issues with graph-aware dependencies |
| `ixchel` | Weave Markdown artifacts into a queryable graph + vector index |

Tools communicate through:
- **stdin/stdout** — Pipe data between commands
- **Files** — Standard formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML)
- **Git** — Sync and collaborate via version control
- **HelixDB** — Shared graph-vector storage when needed
